                         WARNING - DATA USE RESTRICTIONS!

    Please Read Carefully before Using NCHS Public Use Survey Data

    The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease 
    Control and Prevention (CDC), conducts statistical and epidemiological 
    activities under the authority granted by the Public Health Service Act 
    (42 U.S.C. § 242k). NCHS survey data are protected by Federal confidentiality 
    laws including Section 308(d) of the Public Health Service Act 
    (42 U.S.C. 242m(d)) and the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical 
    Efficiency Act (CIPSEA, 44 U.S.C. 3561-3583). These confidentiality laws state 
    that the data collected by NCHS may be used only for statistical reporting and 
    analysis. Any effort to determine the identity of individuals and establishments 
    violates the assurances of confidentiality provided by federal law.

    Terms and Conditions

    NCHS does all it can to assure that the identity of individuals and establishments
    cannot be disclosed.  All direct identifiers, as well as any characteristics 
    that might lead to identification, are omitted from the dataset.  Any
    intentional identification or disclosure of an individual or establishment
    violates the assurances of confidentiality given to the providers of the
    information.  Therefore, users will:

       1.  Use the data in this dataset for statistical reporting and
           analysis only.

       2.  Make no attempt to learn the identity of any person or establishment
           included in these data.

       3.  Not link this dataset with individually identifiable data from
           other NCHS or non-NCHS datasets.

       4.  Not engage in any efforts to assess disclosure methodologies applied to protect 
           individuals and establishments or any research on methods of re-identification of 
           individuals and establishments.

     By using these data, you signify your agreement to comply with the above-stated statutorily
     based requirements.
    
     Sanctions for Violating NCHS Data Use Agreement

     Willfully disclosing any information that could identify a person or establishment in any 
     manner to a person or agency not entitled to receive it, shall be guilty of a class E 
     felony and imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or fined not more than $250,000, or both.

   The Emergency Department (ED) component of the 2022 National Hospital  
   Ambulatory Medical Care Survey is included in this data release.

   For ease of transmission, the data file has been converted into a zipped
   (compressed) format which must be uncompressed prior to use. To uncompress,
   you can do the following:    

   1) Create a new folder on your local workstation, for example, C:\MYFILES\ED2022

   2) Download to the new folder the file ED2022.zip from the FTP server: 
      
      https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Datasets/NHAMCS/

   3) Right-click on the name of the compressed file from your directory screen. On
      the pop-up menu, there should be an option to extract the file to a location of your 
      choosing.

   In the past, the NHAMCS documentation was produced in multiple files
   which were then compressed into a single self-extracting file in ASCII 
   format.  Beginning with 1999, the documentation file has been produced 
   as a single file in PDF format which can be viewed or downloaded from the 
   above address.  This file is not compressed.

   CAUTION - Because NHAMCS is a sample survey, the application of 
   weights to the sample data is REQUIRED to produce national estimates
   of outpatient and emergency department visits, as well as to accurately 
   assess the sampling error of statistics based on the survey data.  Please 
   refer to the documentation for instructions on how to apply the weights 
   and to obtain relative standard errors of national estimates.

   contact the Data Analytics and Production Branch (formerly the Ambulatory 
   and Hospital Care Statistics Branch) at 301-458-4600 or ambcare@cdc.gov.
